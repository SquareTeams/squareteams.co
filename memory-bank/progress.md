# Progress

## What Works
- The basic project structure is in place.
- The main page is rendering with some content.

## What's Left to Build
- The project needs to be optimized for performance.
- The project structure needs to be refactored for better maintainability.
- The UI/UX needs to be enhanced.

## Known Issues
- Large, unoptimized images are impacting performance.
- Multiple animation libraries are increasing the bundle size.
- The main page is client-side rendered, which is not ideal for SEO or initial load times.
