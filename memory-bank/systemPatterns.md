# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application is a server-rendered Next.js application. The front-end is built with React and TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is built using a component-based architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with a global stylesheet for baseline styles.
- **Animations**: GSAP is the primary animation library, chosen for its performance and flexibility.
